# Country Manager
Fancy name, can give you the iso country code for a given list of countries. Had a task at work to manually select these infos and thought why not create a small and nice react app out of it. And here it is. Done in less than an hour. The source is https://countrylayer.com/, kudos to those guy. I am using the free plan so in case your requests are not getting through, it could be that the current maximum of 100 request per month was reached.


## how to use
clone the repo, and use "yarn start" to start the app. That is all. You should see a very minimalistically designed front end. Enter a list of country names (native names allowed, too), either seperated by comma or line break, and hit load. At the moment, only valid results are shown. Check browser console/network tab (F12) for errors. Error handling comes next time... maybe...
